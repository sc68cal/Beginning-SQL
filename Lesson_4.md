### More complex sample databases

The [Chinook Database Project](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/) 
has built a more complex sample database that can be used for further
learning and hands on instruction.

If you download the zipfile, extract it and example the files with
"Sqlite" in the filename. Files with the .sqlite extension are actual
database files that can be opened with the sqlite commandline tool,
while files with the .sql extension are the DDL and DML commands
used to create the .sqlite files.
