### Beginning SQL

This repository contains the material and notes for
a proposed class, organized by Sean Collins, for the
PhillyDB meetup group.

### Questions/Criticism/Contributions

This material is written in the hopes of being understood
by the layman, which requires some hand-waving and incomplete
discussion of topics. As such, I welcome all discussion
and fixes that help bring clarity to topics. In most instances,
links for further study and more advanced discussion are provided.
