#Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematics, used to describe
collections of objects (sets).

Sets can be visualized through the use of Venn diagrams, which
illustrate the relationships between two or more sets.

[The classic two circle Venn Diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Venn_A_intersect_B.svg/220px-Venn_A_intersect_B.svg.png) describes
two sets that contain an intersection. 

##Operations
* [Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_%28set_theory%29)
* [Intersection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_%28set_theory%29)
* [Set Difference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_%28set_theory%29#Relative_complement)
* [Symmetric Difference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)
* [Cartesian Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product)
* [Power Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set)

Caresian products and power sets are the most difficult concepts to master,
so don't feel bad if you don't fully understand them. For now, we'll focus our
energy on learning and discussing simpler operations such as unions, intersections, 
and differences since those will be the operations with equivalents in SQL.

In addition to Venn diagrams, there is also a more compact and formal notation
that describes the composition of sets, called Set Notation. Again, this is a 
more advanced concept that is included to demonstrate the relationship between
abstract math and the basis for SQL.
