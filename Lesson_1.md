#Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematics, used to describe
collections of objects (sets).

Sets can be visualized through the use of Venn diagrams, which
illustrate the relationships between two or more sets.

[The classic two circle Venn Diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Venn_A_intersect_B.svg/220px-Venn_A_intersect_B.svg.png) describes
two sets that contain an intersection.
